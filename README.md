# ML-Model
#### The Main objective is to build a Machine learning model to predict the payment date of invoice when it gets created in the system 
This notebook will run you through :
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Splitting the dataset into train, validation and local test
3. EDA ( Exploratory Data analysis)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature selection
6. standardization , normalization of datasets
7. Choosing the right model which best fits for this case
8. create a base model and train
9. Final Prediction
